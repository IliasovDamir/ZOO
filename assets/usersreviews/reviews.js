My girl friend and I visited the zoo on international red panda day! The two red panda are super cute (I wish they have a name so I can remember them)! The staff were very helpful as well. Young kids have a special area to the left. The train is fun. Food is pretty good but expensive. Overall it’s a nice treat.  Really love this place!'

        userreview: 'Always a nice experience. I’m a member and the people at the entrance sometimes require membership card and ID. We got there first thing when they opened so some of the animals were not out and about yet but was still great fun. food was expensive but as expected. will definitely go back. There are three large, outdoor children`s play areas. I`d say the yearly membership might be worth it for that alone. They lack some of the larger animals such as hippos and elephants. '

        userreview: 'Loved the day at the San Francisco zoo with the family! It is a great zoo that is fun for all ages and offers many experiences for younger kids. There is a train ride through the park, an insect building, a rain Forrest building, a full play ground with multiple themes and plenary of places to go eat. The statue area of animals was entertains to take pictures next to for the kids! The time in the park can easily span 4-5 hours. Bring a light jacket for anytime of the year because the Bay Area does get cold. A pack lunch is acceptable. Lots of animals and the monkeys are always entertaining!'

Her favorites so far are the lemurs and the penguin island, so fun... I think it is a great zoo...I haven`t been to the Oakland zoo, but I have been to the Sacramento zoo and the SF zoo is definitely better. The staff there are wonderful and the views of the animals are amazing! If you have little kids then the train ride near the amazon area is for them and a kid got lost and the workers helped the mom and child reunite'

        userreview: 'Over the years I have seen so many renovations to the SF Zoo; some good, others just ok. Well, it seems that half the zoo is being renovated again to the point that there aren`t a lot of animals to see. There are no more elephants, polar bears or seals. The hippo was sent to another zoo. I have no idea where all the monkeys have gone. Ugh. But, the gardens are beautiful and I will keep supporting the zoo and wait to see the outcome'

        userreview: 'A large zoo with large enclosures for its animals, which resembles a large campus. The zoo needs to improve their maps and markers but overall it was a nice way to spend an afternoon. Many animals hid from the heat. , but we enjoyed seeing those who weren`t home. It was so much fun watching the  new baby giraffe  and the lions were easy to see from a restaurant. It was my first time at the Zoo and I know I will come back. Such a fun place to come with family or friends and I definitely recommend it!'

        userreview: 'We love the zoo. Annual family membership is the best value we ever get, and we also get unlimited rides on the carousel. The staff, administration and volunteers are  great people. We especially liked our driver for the  3D dino exhibition ride who is awesome. Arrive 20 minutes before opening and tickets in advance any day of the week. First go over to feed the giraffes so they are hungry'
